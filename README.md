# Accident Severity Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict the severity of traffic accidents in the United States using machine learning. The dataset contains various features related to traffic accidents, such as location, weather conditions, and traffic-related attributes. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify accident severity based on these features.
